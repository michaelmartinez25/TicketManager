The main screens in our UI revolve around the 8 Use Cases. For Use Case 1,
we have a file menu that provides the general start-up of the application, with 
options to create a new ticket file, save an active file, load a file into 
the program, or quit the application. For Use Case 2, the UI displays the Ticket
List after the user either creates a new ticket list or loads one from a file.
The user can highlight any of the individual tickets in the list to view options
to edit or delete them (which displays in a pop-up menu). The user is also able
to filter the ticket list, show all, or add a new ticket using the buttons at the 
top of the screen. If the user decides to add a new ticket, they are prompted to
another screen, in which they can fill out the fields of a ticket. Error message
pop up if the user does an invalid action. For Use Cases 3-8, the user must select
a ticket and choose to edit it. For Use Case 3, the user can fill in fields to
investigate or cancel a 'New' ticket. For Use Case 4, the user can fill in the 
fields to request 'Feedback,' resolve a 'Working' ticket, or cancel a 'Working' 
ticket. For Use Case 5, there are two screen that can open based on the type of
the ticket: Incident or Request. The user can fill in the fields and reopen a
'Feedback' ticket, resolve a ticket, or cancel a ticket. For Use Case 6, the user
can fill in the fields and request feedback, reopen the ticket, or confirm the 
'Resolved' ticket. For Use Case 7, the user can leave a note and reopen the ticket.
For Use Case 8, the user can only view the displayed information about the 'Closed'
ticket. For each of these Edit Screens, the user also has the option to return to
the main ticket list page without changing anything. We made sure to allow the user
to only change required fields of a ticket; the rest are there for display only 
(as labled with "x" icons).
